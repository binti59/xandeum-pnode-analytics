**Duration:** 2-3 minutes  
**Target:** Superteam bounty judges

---

## Opening (0:00-0:15)

**[Screen: Dashboard landing page]**

"Hello! I'm excited to present the Xandeum pNode Analytics platform - an enterprise-grade monitoring solution that goes far beyond the baseline requirements for this bounty."

---

## Dashboard Overview (0:15-0:45)

**[Highlight: Health Score Circle]**

"The platform features a sophisticated health scoring algorithm that combines availability, version health, and geographic distribution into a single actionable metric. Right now, the network scores 92 out of 100 - healthy status."

**[Scroll to: Network Stats Cards]**

"We're monitoring 242 pNodes across 20 countries with 100% uptime. The platform automatically discovers nodes via gossip protocol and enriches them with geographic data."

**[Highlight: Version Distribution Chart]**

"This donut chart shows version distribution - 78% are on the current 0.8.0 version, with 57 nodes flagged as 'At Risk' for running outdated versions."

**[Highlight: Network Health Timeline]**

"Historical health tracking lets you spot trends - we can see the network has been stable with a 4-point drop from peak."

---

## RPC Accessibility & Intelligent Ranking (0:45-1:15)

**[Highlight: RPC Accessibility Panel]**

"Here's where we differentiate from basic dashboards. The platform automatically scans all 242 nodes for RPC accessibility - currently 6 nodes have open RPC ports with a 2.5% open rate."

**[Highlight: Top Accessible Nodes List]**

"Our intelligent ranking system scores accessible nodes based on uptime, version currency, and performance metrics. These top 5 nodes are your best candidates for reliable RPC connections."

**[Click: First accessible node card to expand]**

"Clicking any accessible node reveals detailed real-time statistics: CPU usage at 0.82%, RAM consumption, active streams, packet counts, and uptime of 8 days. This data updates every 5 minutes automatically."

---

## Geographic Visualization (1:15-1:30)

**[Highlight: Global Distribution Map]**

"The interactive world map visualizes node distribution across 16 locations. Green pulses indicate active nodes - you can immediately see the heavy concentration in Europe with growing presence in North America and Asia."

---

## Rankings Page (1:30-1:50)

**[Navigate to: Rankings page]**

"The Rankings page provides a sortable leaderboard of all accessible nodes. You can sort by health score, uptime, version, or location."

**[Demonstrate: Sorting by different columns]**

"Filter by geographic region, version, or accessibility status. Export the entire dataset to CSV or JSON for external analysis."

---

## Performance Trends (1:50-2:20)

**[Navigate to: Performance page]**

"This is my favorite feature - automated performance trend analysis. The platform collects performance snapshots every 5 minutes for all accessible nodes, building a 24-hour rolling history."

**[Highlight: CPU Usage chart]**

"Four interactive charts show CPU, RAM, uptime, and network activity trends. Use the time range selector to zoom into 1-hour, 6-hour, or 24-hour windows."

**[Highlight: Node selector dropdown]**

"Select any accessible node to view its individual performance history. This helps identify consistently high-performing nodes versus those with erratic behavior."

**[Point to: Automated collection indicator]**

"All of this happens automatically in the background - no manual intervention required. The system starts collecting data the moment the dashboard loads."

---

## Advanced Features Summary (2:20-2:45)

**[Quick scroll through features]**
