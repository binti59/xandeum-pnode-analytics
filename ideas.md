    1. **Raw Data Exposure**: Emphasize the technical nature of the data with monospaced fonts and terminal-like aesthetics.
    2. **High Contrast**: Use stark contrasts to make data pop, ensuring readability while maintaining a distinct look.
    3. **Grid-Based Structure**: Utilize a strict grid layout to organize information logically and efficiently.
    4. **Functional Minimalism**: Strip away unnecessary decorations; every element serves a purpose.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **Digital Phosphor**: A palette inspired by old CRT monitors and command-line interfaces.
    - **Background**: Deep, almost black grey (#0a0a0a) to reduce eye strain and enhance contrast.
    - **Primary**: Electric Green (#00ff41) for active nodes and positive metrics, symbolizing life and activity.
    - **Secondary**: Amber (#ffb000) for warnings or transitional states.
    - **Accent**: Cyan (#00ffff) for links and interactive elements.
    - **Text**: Off-white (#e0e0e0) for general readability.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Modular Dashboard**: A bento-box style layout where each component (stats, charts, tables) lives in its own clearly defined module. The layout is dense but organized, maximizing data density without clutter.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Monospace Typography**: Use a high-quality monospace font (e.g., JetBrains Mono or Fira Code) for all data points to reinforce the engineering focus.
    2. **Scanlines & Glitch Effects**: Subtle CSS animations that mimic screen refresh rates or slight signal interference on hover.
    3. **Visible Borders**: Thin, sharp borders around all modules to define structure clearly.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Tactile Feedback**: Hover states should trigger immediate, sharp visual changes (e.g., color inversion or border thickening) to simulate physical buttons or switches.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Instant & Linear**: Transitions should be fast (100-200ms) with linear easing. No bounces or elastic effects; just precise state changes.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    - **Headings**: Bold, uppercase monospace.
    - **Body**: Regular monospace for data; sans-serif for explanatory text to create hierarchy.
  </typography_system>

  <design_movement>Glassmorphism / Neo-Skeuomorphism</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Translucency & Depth**: Use blurred backgrounds and layered elements to create a sense of depth and hierarchy.
    2. **Soft Lighting**: Mimic natural light sources to create gentle highlights and shadows.
    3. **Fluidity**: Elements should feel like they are floating or suspended in a medium.
    4. **Clean & Airy**: ample whitespace to let the content breathe.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **Ethereal Sky**: A palette inspired by the sky at dawn.
    - **Background**: A soft, animated gradient of pale blue (#e0f7fa) and lavender (#e1bee7).
    - **Glass Panels**: White with low opacity and background blur (backdrop-filter) for cards.
    - **Primary**: Deep Ocean Blue (#01579b) for key metrics and buttons.
    - **Text**: Dark Slate (#37474f) for high contrast against light backgrounds.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Floating Cards**: Content is contained within rounded, semi-transparent cards that float above the background. The layout is fluid and responsive, adapting gracefully to screen size.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Frosted Glass**: The defining visual trait, applied to cards and navigation bars.
    2. **Soft Shadows**: Diffused, colored shadows that match the element's content to create a glow effect.
    3. **Rounded Corners**: Generous border-radius (16px+) to enhance the organic, friendly feel.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Fluid Response**: Elements gently lift or glow when interacted with, simulating buoyancy.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Smooth & Organic**: Transitions are slow (300-500ms) with ease-in-out curves. Elements fade and slide into place.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    - **Headings**: A clean, geometric sans-serif (e.g., Inter or DM Sans) with tight tracking.
    - **Body**: A highly readable sans-serif with open counters.
  </typography_system>

  <design_movement>Swiss Style / International Typographic Style</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Objective Clarity**: The primary goal is to present information without ambiguity or distraction.
    2. **Asymmetric Balance**: Use asymmetry to create dynamic, interesting layouts that guide the eye.
    3. **Grid Systems**: A mathematical grid underpins every placement, ensuring alignment and proportion.
    4. **Typography as Image**: Large, bold typography serves as the primary visual element.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **Primary Pop**: A neutral base with bold, primary accent colors.
    - **Background**: Stark White (#ffffff) or very light grey (#f5f5f5).
    - **Primary**: International Orange (#ff3b30) or Swiss Red (#d80000) for emphasis.
    - **Secondary**: Black (#000000) for strong structural lines and text.
    - **Accent**: Cobalt Blue (#0047bb) for data visualization.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Asymmetric Grid**: Content is aligned to a strict grid but distributed asymmetrically to create tension and interest. White space is used actively to separate sections.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Huge Typography**: massive headings that act as graphic elements.
    2. **Thick Rules**: Heavy horizontal or vertical lines to separate content areas.
    3. **Geometric Shapes**: Simple circles or squares used for icons or data points.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Direct & Snappy**: Interactions are immediate and precise. No fading or blurring; things appear or disappear instantly or with a very fast slide.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Minimal & Functional**: Animations are used only to guide the user (e.g., a slide to show context), not for decoration.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    - **Headings**: Helvetica Now or Akzidenz-Grotesk (or a close free alternative like Roboto or Inter in heavy weights).
    - **Body**: A neutral sans-serif set with generous leading.
  </typography_system>
